          Cloud Web Training is a fully animated website aimed at companies and
          small businesses who are looking to move into the cloud but are not
          yet sure how to start. The website guides people on the best steps to
          take and educates them on the features which they may need in their
          company and also the recommended providers and features for what they
          require.

          The main issues which i faced when implementing this project was how
          to set the 'Parallax Scrolling' effect, i was able to add the effect
          however the main issue that i was facing was the image was overlapping
          the sections below and not giving me the desired effect.
        </div>
        <div className={classes.OverviewBody}>
          I found that when trying to implement the Parallax Scrolling effect, i
          needed to add a z-index for the image and then add an additional
          padding section below the image so that the image is then hidden under
          the padding. Once i had put this in place i was the able to achieve
          the effect i was looking for.
